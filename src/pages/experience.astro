      So usually one would start their jobs journey from the present to the
      past. (like LinkedIn Profiles :üîù ‚¨á).<br /> However I would like you to know
      how I began my journey and became a Front end developer. Therefor I'll be going
      from the past to the present
      <br /><br />
      So I just graduated from college. An year before my graduation, I started building
      websites for my college using PHP
      <br /> Later I realized writing PHP felt lousy.Hence I decided to learn Javascript.
      <br /> I soon realised that I want to continue writing Javascript in my future
      jobs.<br />
      <p class="text-amber-700 dark:text-amber-300">
        This preference made me turn down my first job offer in college which
        would have gone south of what I actually wanted to do. (May be JAVA ü§î)
      </p>
      <br />
      So, I decided to join a start up which was nothing when I started but still
      decided to take the risk since it was a Javascript role :YAY üòÅ
      <br /><p class="text-xl dark:text-amber-300 font-bold">
        That Start up was ‚¨áÔ∏è
