      So usually one would start saying about their work experience from present
      to past.(like LinkedIn Profiles :üîù ‚¨á)<br /> However I would like you to know
      how I began my journey and became a Front end developer. So I will be going
      from past to present
      <br /><br />
      So I just graduated from college. An year before my graduation, I started building
      websites for my college using PHP
      <br /> Later I realized writing PHP felt lousy and picked up Javascript.
      <br /> I soon realised that I want to continue writing Javascript and turned
      down my first job offer which would have gone south of what I actually wanted.
      (May be JAVA ü§î)
      <br />Anyways, I decided to join a start up which was nothing when I
      started but still decided to take the risk since it was a Javascript role
      :YAY üòÅ
      <br /><br /><p class="text-xl dark:text-slate-400 font-bold">
        That Start up was ‚¨áÔ∏è
